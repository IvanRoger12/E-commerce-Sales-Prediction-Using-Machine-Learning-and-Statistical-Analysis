# E-commerce-Sales-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning-and-Statistical-Analysis
This project demonstrates how to use Machine Learning and Statistical Analysis in Python to predict monthly sales for an e-commerce business. It includes an exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization of trends, and a predictive model using Linear Regression.

Project Overview
Objective: Predict future sales based on historical data and visualize sales trends across different product categories.
Tools & Libraries:
Python
Pandas
Matplotlib
Scikit-learn (Linear Regression)
Features
Exploratory Data Analysis:

Analysis of monthly sales trends.
Distribution of sales by product category.
Machine Learning Model:

Linear Regression model to predict future sales.
Performance evaluation using Mean Squared Error (MSE).
Visualizations:

Monthly sales trends.
Sales by product category.
Real vs Predicted sales comparison.
Installation
Clone the repository:
bash
Copier le code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ecommerce-sales-prediction.git
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copier le code
cd ecommerce-sales-prediction
Install required dependencies:
bash
Copier le code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Run the Python script:
bash
Copier le code
python ecommerce_sales_prediction.py
The script will output several visualizations and the model's Mean Squared Error (MSE).
Dataset
This project uses a simulated dataset for e-commerce sales, including:

Invoice Date
Quantity Sold
Unit Price
Product Category
You can replace the dataset with your own e-commerce data.

Results
The model successfully predicts future sales with a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 5,604,869. Visualizations show trends and comparisons of real and predicted sales.
